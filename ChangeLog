	* schemas errors : Made gWaei run fine without crashing even if the schemas
	* gnome-doc-utils configure : configure no longer fails when gnome-doc-utils
	is missing when only compiling waei.
	* Addition of libunique : gWaei is now a single instance application.
	Future improvements will use this to manage multiple windows of the program.
	* Memory leak in Radical Search tool fixed : Fixed by Mikael Magnusson
	* Fixes to romaji->hiragana conversion : The progam was having problems
	interpreting symbolic n.
	* New Man pages added : Written by Asumu Takikawa
	* Added German/French/Spanish dictionaries : These are offshoots of the
	edict dictionaryies.
	* better color highlighting for the console : Different colors are used to
	make different part of results easier to read.
	* Radical search tool buttons gray out : The racials that aren't available
	gray out to help make searching easier.
	* New formatting for results that is easier to read : The meanings of the
	results are indented in to make them easier to skim.  Kanji searches now
	show an overview of the returned kanji at the top.
