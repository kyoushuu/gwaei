	* Doxygen : Created documentation for much of the program
	* Everything : Massive code cleanups in the program.
	* New fonts for Kanji : ttf-arphic-ukai, ttf-kanjistrokeorders 
	* Kanji sidebar redesign : Kanji stroke orders are shown in in the kanji
	sidebar background made to be more cohesive.  Centered.
	* Results grouping : results starting with the same kanji are grouped for
	legibility.
	* Added IRC channel links and homepage links in various places.
	* Buttons/menus change when text is highlighted : Shows that the action only
	is applied to the highlighted text.
	* ui xml has been moved directly to gtkbuilder : there is no more conversion
	of the glade file with the glade conversion script anymore.
	* Menus moved to GtkActions : helps to simplify the code
	* Updated documentation : The help documents etc have been updated.
	* Redesigned main window : It has been rethrought and balanced out.  New
	clear search and search start button.  Progress bar in the lower right hand
	corner.
	* Drag and drop target moved : It is now accomplished by dragging into the
	main results area to intitiate an automatic search.
	* The whole interface in now translated : some previously untranslatable
	items have been made translatable.
	* New keybindings : Tab no longer changes dictionaries.  Alt-# or
	alt-up/alt-down does. Alt-left/alt-right now appears in the history menu.
