	* queryline-object.c: Finished writing new search backend
	* searchitem-object.c: Improvements to the handling of comparisons.  Better
	                       handling of unknown dictionary formats.
	* utilities.c: The katakana "-" now will have no effect on the outcome of a
	               hiragana/katakana test.
	* main-interface-gtk.c: Added the ability to start gwaei with an initial
	                        search from a specific dictionary.
	* sexy-enable.c: Better spellcheck dictionary selection that chooses the
	                 correct one for the known dictionaries. (French, English, Germain...)
	* settings-interface-gtk.c: Interface tweaks for the preferences.  Cleaner
	                            and more minimalistic.
	* settings-interface-gtk.c: gWaei now uses the gnome set font as it's
	                            default font instead of sans.
	* README: Added autogen.sh information to the readme.
	* debian/rpm: Updated the summary to no longer do a direct comparison to
	              gjiten
	* tabs.c: Added tab functionality to gWaei.
	* dictinfo-object.c: Dictionary names are now more localization friendly.
	* main-interfec-gtk.c: Search status information now appears in the window
	                       title much like it does for web browsers etc.
	* main-interface-console.c: multisearch capability through the console
	                            through an interface build with ncurses.
	* main.c: gobject dependency was missing for some linux distros as glib.h
	          didn't automatically import it without gtk.h
	* main-interface-gtk.c: Added flag to force a new instance of the program
	                        when wanted.
