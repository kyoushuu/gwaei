	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add po/Makefile.in.

2011-01-10   Lowered Libcurl required version <pizzach@gmail.com>
    * Lowered the required libcurl version
		* Updated the language files using make distcheck.

2011-01-04 Various fixes to usage issues <pizzach@gmail.com>
    * Edits to thread locking during less relevant result display to make the interface
      more responsive.
    * Readded exact matching for the console version of gWaei because of how
		  useful it is there from how consoles autoscroll passed the useful
			results.
    * Fixed the & symbol so that the letters after it don't get deleted when
      a search is started.
    * Added a max number of relevant/exact results because the program
      basically dies when trying to output passed 300 or so of them.
