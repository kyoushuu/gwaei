2009-11-14: Released gWaei 1.2.1
  A bug fix release.  People sent in problems and various things were fixed.
  A few random crashers when waei was used with no running gtk using environment
  and when starting gwaei.  Also, the installation prodecure was fixed when doing
  --disable-schemas-install.  Sorry packagers!
