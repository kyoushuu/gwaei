2010-10-08: gWaei 1.4.3
  New version meant to be easier to compile with the new Fedora/Ubuntu versions coming out by updating the autoconf and gettext files.  There was a bit of makefile cleanup to use -I correctly for the gWaei header files instead of manually compiling them all.  Dictionary line count used for progress is now dynamically calculated during searches and stored in the preferences instead of on each startup.
