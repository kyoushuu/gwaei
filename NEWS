2010-02-17: Released gWaei 1.3.0
  New major release.  It should hopefully be more bugfree than 1.2.0 was.  Significant changes include a newly implimented backend for searches, tabs, a multisearch interface implimented by fabrizio for the console implimented using ncurses and simplified preferences dialog.

  Smaller but noticable improvements include more intelligent choosing of spellcheck dictionaries for different languages, various bugfixes to the engine, and improved localization code.
