2009-10-25: Released gWaei 1.2.0
  Offical 1.2.0 release!  The results have been worked to have better,
  easier to skim formatting. New German, French, and Spanish dictionaries
  have been added.  The dictionaries are now user organizable.  The radicals
  in the Radical search tool now grey out when certain combinations do not
  return any kanji.  Other general improvements to make the program easier to
  use and remove bugs.  Packagers, please read my messages to you in the README.
