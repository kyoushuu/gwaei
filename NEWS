2010-11-25: gWaei 1.5.0
  First version to truely allow compilation on Windows.  Fixed the search thread so it no longer runs in a timer, but truly another thread.  GConf has been dropped for GSettings.  The program compiles with the GTK_DEPRICATED_DISABLE flag on.  The kanjisidebar is now a tooltip.  There has been a bit of scaling back on the interface. Searches now update dynamically as you type.
