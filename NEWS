2010-01-10: gWaei 1.5.2
  Bugfix release. Searches when using & in the query work again instead of being
  truncated as you type.  The interface is now more responsive when a search is carried
  out by edits to thread locking.  Exact matching for the console version
  of gWaei was readded because it is truly needed there.  The sandboxing issue
  caused by gtk-update-icon-cache for the package maintainers.  The README has been updated
  as it was woefully out of date.
