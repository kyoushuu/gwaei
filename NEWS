2009-10-09: Released gWaei 1.0
  Offical 1.1 release!  A bunch of changes made it into the program.  Much of
  the main interface has been rethought out. Bugs squashed, code reworked.
  Much of the program has been documented using doxygen, a new IRC help channel
  setup, and links to the homepage from the program.

  This release requires Gnome 2.26 level dependencies.  This would be about 
  Fedora 11 or Ubuntu 9 level.
