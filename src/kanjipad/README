*******************

To use this kanjipad library you need to call three functions after including
the kanjipad.h header

/* Set the entry to append the result to*/
void kanjipad_set_target_text_widget(GtkWidget* widget);

/* Initialize kanjipad.  This should only be done once*/
void initialize_kanjipad ();

/* The method to be called when you want the kanjipad window to pop up*/
void show_kanjipad (GtkBuilder* builder);


Kanjipad requires you to build against:
  gtk+-2.0
  gconf-2.0
  gmodule-export-2.0

These files should be passed to gcc with your program:
  include/gwaei/utilities.h
  include/gwaei/definitions.h
  kanjipad/callbacks.c
  kanjipad/callbacks.h
  kanjipad/kanjipad.c
  kanjipad/kanjipad.h
  kanjipad/padarea.c
  kanjipad/padarea.h
