1.0 PREREQUISITES:

  To run gWaei 1.1, an environment with at least gtk+-2.16/glib-2.9.0,
  gconf-2.24.0, curl 7.19.6, gnome-doc-utils-0.14.0 and libsexy-0.1.11 are
  required.  Additionally, you will want to have rsync, gzip and
  kanjistrokeorders  available.  Most of these are satisfied with a
  default install of Gnome 2.26 or newer which should come with Ubuntu 9.04
  and Fedora 11. There are also 2 fonts you may want which will make the kanji
  look nicer.  ttf-kanjistrokeorders and ttf-arphic-ukai.  The previous is a
  dependency in the deb and rpm so that it gets pulled in on install.

  An example of a command that Ubuntu/Debian users might use to get the
  required runtime dependancies is:

  sudo apt-get install libcurl3 libgtk2.0-0 libsexy2 libgconf2-4\ 
  ttf-kanjistrokeorders ttf-arphic-ukai gnome-doc-utils

  To compile the program, you will have to have the dev files for  GCONF2,
  GTK+, CURL3 and LIBSEXY and available. Users with binary based distributions
  should install the approprate "dev" or "devel" files for the above
  dependencies using their package manager. Automake and GCC will come in handy
  too, as they are standard build tools for GNU systems.  If you want rsync
  update functionality available for the dictionaries, you will need to make
  sure that rsync is available when compiling, otherwise it will be perminently
  disabled.

  An example of a command that Ubuntu/Debian users might use to get the
  required compilation dependancies is:

  sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libgtk2.0-dev libsexy-dev\
  libgconf2-dev build-essential gnome-doc-utils

  For inputing Japanese queries, installing some software for Japanese
  conversion is highly recommended.  Currently, the two main linux methods are
  UIM or SCIM using the ANTHY engine.  For emergency situations where users
  can't install either, gWaei has internal support for converting romanji
  searches to hiragana/katakana automatically.  (This conversion is disabled
  for Japanese locals.)



2.0 CONFIGURATION AND INSTALLATION:

  When configuring, the two most important variables for this program are
  prefix and sysconfdir.  The sysconfdir will decide where the gconf schemas
  will be installed.  This is normally in /etc/gconf/schemas.  For Debian users,
  it's /usr/gconf/schemas.  BSDs tend to use /usr/pkg/gconf/schemas.  If you
  choose the wrong location for the schemas, installation will usually fail. 
  Most users will install using steps similar to below.

  2.1 BUILDING AND INSTALLING FROM THE SOURCE:
    $ ./configure --prefix /usr --sysconfdir /etc
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

  2.2 UNINSTALL:
    $ sudo make uninstall



3.0 MAKING A DEB PACKAGE:

  If you are not using i386 as your archtecture, you should switch it in
  configure.ac beforehand. You will then need to configure the installer with
  any needed options using "./configure". After that just run "make deb" to
  have the deb install file created in the base of the gwaei folder.

  i386 Ubuntu users will do something similar to this to create the deb:
    $ ./configure --prefix /usr --sysconf /etc
    $ make deb
  i386 Debian users will do something similiar to this to create the deb:
    $ ./configure --prefix /usr --sysconf /usr
    $ make deb

  If you are lazy, you can also use a shortcut for Ubuntu:
    $ ./configure
    $ make ubuntu-deb



4.0 MAKING AN RPM PACKAGE:

  You will need to have the rpmbuilder executable available before proceeding.
  On some architectures it is included with the rpm package itself.  On others
  you will need to install the rpm-build package.
  
  If you are not using i386 as your archtecture, you should switch it in
  configure.ac beforehand. You will need to configure the installer with any
  needed options using "./configure". It will do the work of setting up the
  spec file correctly for you.  Then run "make rpm" to actually build the rpm
  for your architecture. The newly created rpm will appear at the base of the
  gwaei folder.

  Most users will get their rpm by doing something similar to this:
    $ ./configure --prefix /usr --sysconf /etc
    $ make rpm

  If you are lazy, you can also use a shortcut for Fedora:
    $ ./configure
    $ make fedora-rpm


5.0 COMPILING ON WINDOWS:

  Work has been started to make gWaei compile and work on windows.  Currently,
  only waei as of writing this works.  To compile, you will need the MingGW
  environment, gtk win32 binary, libgnurx win32 binary, xslt win32 binary,
  libxml win32 binary and curl source, gnome-doc-utils source.
  
  You will need to compile the curl dll with only ftp and http and file support
  to simplify dependancies. There is info on it in the documentation.
  
  The xslt and libxml binaries are to simplify gnome-doc-utils installation.

  If you can install these through some other method, go for it.  The actual
  setup and installation of gWaei will look like so:

    ./configure --prefix /usr/local --enable-win32 --disable-schemas-install
    make
    make install

  That's it.  If someone wants to help sort out the final issues with getting
  the program running on Windows, please feel free to get in contact with
  one of the developers on the gWaei homepage.
